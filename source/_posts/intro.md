#### Introduction

Welcome to the official blog of [Webellion Ltd](http://webellionlimited.com)! This collection of development tools, use cases, stories and not the least personal experiences serves as a technical almanach of challenges we face on a daily basis when it comes to modern web development. 

#### About Webellion Limited
> Another start-up? 
Yes! 
> Oh gosh. 
I know.

Since the software industry has witnessed an unparalelled boom in technologies, methods and culture, it is needless to say that progression and adaptation has increasingly become a vital key in success for software companies. [Webellion Ltd](http://webellionlimited.com) is a start-up that is devoted to deliver business values through simplicity. Our goal is to analyse business requirements, transform then into deliverables and provide tangible results within short timeframes. In order to fully achieve this commitment, we employ cutting edge agile methodoligies that is tailored to our working culture.  

 #### RDD
"Release driven development". Our mission is to deliver first and refactor later. This is not  evolutionary, especially considering that [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) and [delivery](https://martinfowler.com/books/continuousDelivery.html) have without doubts become fundamental instruments of software development. Although these methods have been widely adopted by a huge number of teams, I personally have not seen many of them adjusting their delivery process to the principals of [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) with substential success. Alongside many recurring issues, more often than none the most demanding challenge appears to be the management of teams and dependencies rather than any technology or knowledge related barriers. 

[Webellion Ltd](http://webellionlimited.com) addresses this issue with focusing on business values and deliverables by defining business driven milestones. With well defined [scrum](https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum) sprints and applying [extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) our customers are provided the quintessential tools to participate, interact and possibly intervene in the development process. 

#### Posts
We strive to share our business cases, experiences with various technologies and clients, mostly approaching issues and concerns from unusual aspects to tackle the underlying causes. The posts attempt to touch on problems that are not always talked about amongst tech people and therefore might cause enginners to make self-justifying decisions that may ultimately influence the productivity of the project in a negative manner. 

Of course, we also cover trending web frameworks, libraries and tools and reveal our experience with them in production environments.
